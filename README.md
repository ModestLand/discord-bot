### Information

This bot was created for a friend who streams discord. She's a Family Friendly streamer so she wanted her discord to have the same moderation standards as her streams.  
So modest bot was born. Utilizing Twitch's Automod API we're able to get the same automod from Twitch into discord.

### Disclaimer

This is my first real rust project. It's probably <u>rust</u>ic.
